## Features

It has so many features and tools integrated that even I have lost track of many of them.

But I'll keep moving forward and adding more of them cause I can and I most definitely will.

Maybe I'll list them somewhere in the repository along with references and screenshots, who knows.

## Setup

I haven't had time to write an install script for this config, coming soon... or maybe never.
